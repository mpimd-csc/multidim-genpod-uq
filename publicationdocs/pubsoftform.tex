%% List of all developers.

%% List of all people who contributed knwoledge and ideas rather than active
%% work on the software project, i.e. whose research results are affected. 
%% Especially think about those features in the code where papers are still
%% under revision or even in preparation.  
%% Applicants and developers may be listed here as well in addition to further
%% MPI Magdeburg affiliates.
%% This is a description-type list environment, where each feature is an item
%% and the item text is the list of signature lines.
